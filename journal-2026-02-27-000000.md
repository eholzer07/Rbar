# Session Journal — 2026-02-27

## Session Goal
High-level project planning session for the Rbar project. Goal is to define the major chunks of work without going into per-session implementation detail.

## Milestones

### Session Start
- Read rules file — all rules in sync with MEMORY.md
- Checked project root: only README.md exists (clean slate)
- Beginning discovery conversation to define project scope and major work chunks

### Project Plan Complete
Gathered requirements through conversation. Key decisions made:
- **What:** Sports fan venue finder — find bars/restaurants showing your team's game while traveling
- **Sports:** All major US leagues (NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, MLS) + NCAA + international soccer
- **Scope:** US only at launch, web first then mobile (React Native)
- **Auth:** Email/password at launch
- **Venue seeding:** Hybrid — admin seeds from internet research, then crowdsourced
- **Tech stack:** Next.js + TypeScript, PostgreSQL + PostGIS, Prisma, NextAuth.js, Vercel + Supabase, Google Maps API, TheSportsDB API

**Created:**
- `PROJECT_PLAN.md` — 16 work chunks covering full scope from infrastructure to mobile
- `docs/chunks/README.md` — session doc tracker for each chunk
- Project folder structure: `src/`, `prisma/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`, `docs/`

**Next session:** Chunk 1 — Project Setup & Infrastructure
